# MetaTrader 5 Python API: `order_calc_profit` Function

## Overview

The `order_calc_profit` function calculates the potential profit in the account currency for a specified trading operation. This function is essential for pre-trade analysis, risk management, and position planning, as it allows traders to determine the potential profit for a trade before executing it. By estimating the result of a trading operation in the current market environment, traders can make more informed decisions about position sizing, take-profit levels, and overall trade viability.

## Function Syntax

```python
order_calc_profit(
   action,          # order type (ORDER_TYPE_BUY or ORDER_TYPE_SELL)
   symbol,          # symbol name
   volume,          # volume
   price_open,      # open price
   price_close      # close price
)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `action` | integer | Order type, taking values from the ORDER_TYPE enumeration. Only ORDER_TYPE_BUY or ORDER_TYPE_SELL are valid for this function. Required unnamed parameter. |
| `symbol` | string | Financial instrument name (e.g., "EURUSD"). Required unnamed parameter. |
| `volume` | float | Trading operation volume in lots. Required unnamed parameter. |
| `price_open` | float | Open price at which the position would be entered. Required unnamed parameter. |
| `price_close` | float | Close price at which the position would be exited. Required unnamed parameter. |

## Return Value

Returns a float value representing the estimated profit in the account currency if successful.

Returns `None` in case of an error, which can be checked using the `last_error()` function.

## ORDER_TYPE Constants for the action Parameter

Only two values from the ORDER_TYPE enumeration are valid for this function:

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| ORDER_TYPE_BUY | 0 | Market buy order (long position) |
| ORDER_TYPE_SELL | 1 | Market sell order (short position) |

## Important Notes

- You must call `initialize()` to establish a connection to the MetaTrader 5 terminal before using `order_calc_profit()`
- The function estimates the potential profit on the current account and in the current market environment
- For buy orders (long positions), profit is calculated as: (close_price - open_price) × volume × contract_size
- For sell orders (short positions), profit is calculated as: (open_price - close_price) × volume × contract_size
- The calculation takes into account the contract size, swap rates, and commission settings for the symbol
- Currency conversions are applied automatically if the symbol profit currency differs from the account currency
- The function is similar to the MQL5 function `OrderCalcProfit()`

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Profit Calculation for Various Symbols

```python
import MetaTrader5 as mt5

# Establish connection to the MetaTrader 5 terminal
if not mt5.initialize():
    print("initialize() failed, error code =", mt5.last_error())
    quit()

# Get account currency for display purposes
account_info = mt5.account_info()
if account_info is None:
    print("Failed to get account info, error code =", mt5.last_error())
    mt5.shutdown()
    quit()

account_currency = account_info.currency
print("Account Currency:", account_currency)

# Define the list of symbols to check
symbols = ["EURUSD", "GBPUSD", "USDJPY", "AUDUSD", "USDCAD", "NZDUSD"]
lot_size = 1.0
pip_distance = 100  # Calculate profit for 100 pips movement

print(f"Profit Calculations for {lot_size} lot with {pip_distance} pips movement:")
print("-" * 60)

# Calculate profit for both buy and sell scenarios
for symbol in symbols:
    # Make sure the symbol is available
    symbol_info = mt5.symbol_info(symbol)
    if symbol_info is None:
        print(f"{symbol} not found, skipped")
        continue
    
    # Select the symbol in Market Watch if it's not visible
    if not symbol_info.visible:
        print(f"{symbol} is not visible, trying to select it...")
        if not mt5.symbol_select(symbol, True):
            print(f"Failed to select {symbol}, skipped")
            continue
    
    # Get the current bid and ask prices
    tick = mt5.symbol_info_tick(symbol)
    if tick is None:
        print(f"Failed to get tick data for {symbol}, error:", mt5.last_error())
        continue
    
    # Get symbol point value
    point = symbol_info.point
    
    # Calculate target prices for profit calculation
    buy_open = tick.ask
    buy_close = buy_open + (pip_distance * 10 * point)  # 10 points = 1 pip for 5-digit brokers
    
    sell_open = tick.bid
    sell_close = sell_open - (pip_distance * 10 * point)
    
    # Calculate potential profit
    buy_profit = mt5.order_calc_profit(mt5.ORDER_TYPE_BUY, symbol, lot_size, buy_open, buy_close)
    sell_profit = mt5.order_calc_profit(mt5.ORDER_TYPE_SELL, symbol, lot_size, sell_open, sell_close)
    
    if buy_profit is not None and sell_profit is not None:
        print(f"{symbol}:")
        print(f"  Buy  {lot_size} lot(s) at {buy_open:.5f}, close at {buy_close:.5f}: {buy_profit:.2f} {account_currency}")
        print(f"  Sell {lot_size} lot(s) at {sell_open:.5f}, close at {sell_close:.5f}: {sell_profit:.2f} {account_currency}")
        
        # Calculate profit per pip
        buy_profit_per_pip = buy_profit / pip_distance
        sell_profit_per_pip = sell_profit / pip_distance
        
        print(f"  Profit per pip (Buy):  {buy_profit_per_pip:.2f} {account_currency}")
        print(f"  Profit per pip (Sell): {sell_profit_per_pip:.2f} {account_currency}")
    else:
        print(f"{symbol}: Profit calculation failed, error code =", mt5.last_error())
    
    print()

## Error Handling

When `order_calc_profit()` encounters errors:
1. It returns `None`
2. Check for errors with `last_error()`
3. Verify that initialization was successful before calling this function
4. Ensure the symbol is available and selected in Market Watch

Common errors include:
- Symbol not found in the list of available symbols
- Invalid order type specified (only ORDER_TYPE_BUY or ORDER_TYPE_SELL are valid)
- Invalid volume or price values
- Terminal connectivity issues
- Symbol not selected in Market Watch

## Best Practices

1. **Connection Management**: Always establish a connection with `initialize()` before using trading functions
2. **Symbol Selection**: Ensure the symbol is available and selected with `symbol_select()` before calculation
3. **Error Checking**: Always check if the return value is `None` and handle errors appropriately
4. **Current Prices**: Use the latest ask price for buy orders and bid price for sell orders
5. **Lot Size Validation**: Verify that the volume is within the allowed range (min/max lot size) for the symbol
6. **Currency Awareness**: Be mindful of currency conversions when the symbol's profit currency differs from the account currency
7. **Account Context**: Consider the current account state when interpreting profit calculations
8. **Resource Cleanup**: Always call `shutdown()` when finished with MetaTrader 5 operations

## Implementation Notes

The `order_calc_profit()` function calculation is based on several factors:

1. **Contract Size**: The standard contract size for the symbol (e.g., 100,000 units for standard forex lots)
2. **Symbol Point Value**: The minimum price change value for the symbol
3. **Account Currency**: Calculations are performed in the account currency
4. **Price Difference**: The difference between the open and close prices
5. **Symbol Specifications**: The specifics of how profit is calculated for the given symbol type

For accurate profit calculations, consider:

1. **Spreads**: The calculation does not account for the spread, so for realistic calculations, use appropriate entry and exit prices
2. **Swaps/Rollover**: The calculation does not include overnight swap rates, which affect profit for positions held overnight
3. **Commissions**: The calculation does not include broker commissions, which should be factored in separately for total trade cost
4. **Currency Conversion**: The profit is automatically converted to the account currency, which may introduce slight variations due to exchange rates

Note that while `order_calc_profit()` provides an estimate, actual profit may vary slightly when a position is closed, particularly during volatile market conditions or when trading illiquid instruments.
